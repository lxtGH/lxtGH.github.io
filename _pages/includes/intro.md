I am **Xiangtai Li (李祥泰)** and I work on computer vision and related problems.

Previously, I worked as a **Research Fellow** at [MMLab@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/), S-Lab advised by [Prof.Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/) and research scientist intern in JD AI / Sensetime / Shanghai AI Laboratory.

I obtained my PhD degree at Peking University under the supervision of [Prof.Yunhai Tong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T4gqdPkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and my bachelor's degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

My research topics are:

1, Scene understanding tasks. (Image/Video/3D detection and segmentation)

2, Multi-modal learning with LLMs. (Connect visual perception with Large language models)

3, Image/Video Generation/Synthesis/Editing. (Diffusion models)


Besides, I am also very interested at aerial image analysis since I am a fun of history and military games. 

[//]: # (During my PhD, I conducted research on image/video semantic/instance/panoptic segmentation, as well as several related scene understanding problems.)

Moreover, most of my works, including the ones I have profoundly contributed to, are open-sourced on GitHub.
