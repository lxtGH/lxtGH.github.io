I am **Xiangtai Li (李祥泰)**, working as a **Research Scientist** at ByteDance/Tiktok (Singapore) for computer vision and related problems.

Previously, I worked as a **Research Fellow** at [MMLab@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/), S-Lab advised by [Prof.Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/) and research intern or research scientist in JD Exploration Academy / Sensetime / Shanghai AI Laboratory / 2050 Research.

I obtained my PhD degree at Peking University (PKU) under the supervision of [Prof.Yunhai Tong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T4gqdPkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and my bachelor's degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT).

My research topics are:
 
Multi-modal learning with LLMs. (Connect visual perception with Large language models) and Image, Video Generation/Synthesis/Editing.

Previously, I did some works on Image/Video/3D detection and segmentation.

Moreover, the code and models for my works (maybe 98%), including the ones I have profoundly contributed to, are open-sourced on GitHub.

Find the code and models [here](https://github.com/lxtGH).
