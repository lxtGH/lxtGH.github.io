My research topics are:

1, Scene understanding tasks. (Image/Video/3D detection and segmentation)

2, Multi-modal learning with LLMs. (Connect visual perception with Large language models)

3, Image/Video Generation/Synthesis. (Diffusion models)


Besides, I am also very interested at aerial image analysis since I am a fun of history and military games. 

During my PhD, I conducted research on image/video semantic/instance/panoptic segmentation, as well as several related problems.
