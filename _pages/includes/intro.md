I am **Xiangtai Li (李祥泰)** and I work as a **Research Fellow** at [MMLab@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/), S-Lab advised by [Prof.Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/).

I also work as a part-time consultant in Open-MMLab@Shanghai AI Laboratory, led by [Dr.Yining Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=y_cp1sUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr.Kai Chen](https://chenkai.site/).

Previously, I obtained my PhD degree at Peking University under the supervision of [Prof.Yunhai Tong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T4gqdPkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and my bachelor's degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
I also worked closely with [Prof.Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/) and [Prof.Dacheng Tao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RwlJNLcAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research work focuses on several directions, including pixel-wise scene understanding for video/image scene understanding (such as semantic/instance/panoptic segmentation and object detection), their zero/few shot variants, 
general deep learning methods with applications (such as vision transformer, efficient model design, and neural collapse), and vision meets language (including open vocabulary learning, visual prompting, and visual grounding) and 
foundation model tuning. 

Besides, I am also very interested at aerial image analysis since I am a fun of history and military games. 

During my PhD, I conducted research on image/video semantic/instance/panoptic segmentation, as well as several related problems.
